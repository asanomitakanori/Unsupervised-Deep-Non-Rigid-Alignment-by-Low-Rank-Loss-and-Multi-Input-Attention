## Overview of our method
![Illustration](./image/proposed_method_overview.png)
> Overview of proposed method, which consists of three subnetworks $f_n$, $f_r$, $f_c$.
## Requirements
```
$ pip install -r requirements.py
```
Python3.6
PyTorch
Hydra (hydra-core)

## Train & Validation 
You can train and validation by run.py
### Example
```
$ python run.py
```

### Preparation
Please prepare your data as follows

    │       (Same structure of train_imgs. Without eval_img, part of train_img is used for evaluation)
    └── test_imgs
            (Same structure of train_imgs)

### Arguments
You can set up input path/output path/parameters from 
[config/config.yaml](https://github.com/asanomitakanori/Unsupervised-Deep-Non-Rigid-Alignment-by-Low-Rank-Loss-and-Multi-Input-Attention/blob/main/config/config.yaml)

## Testing (measuring Dice scores)
To test the quality of a model by computing dice overlap between an atlas segmentation and warped test scan segmentations, run:
```
$ python test.py
```

## Tensorboard 
command in teminal at working dir
